    <p class="abstract abstract-font">We introduce DeepSPEC, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) -based approach for frequency-and-phase correction (FPC) of MRS spectra. In DeepSPEC, two neural networks (one for frequency correction and one for phase correction) were trained and validated using published simulated and in vivo MEGA-PRESS MRS dataset with wide-range artificial frequency and phase offsets applied. DeepSPEC was subsequently tested and compared to the current deep learning solution, a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based approach. Furthermore, random noise was added to the original simulated dataset to further investigate the model performance at varied signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. The testing showed that DeepSPEC is more robust to noise compared to the MLP-based approach due to having a smaller mean absolute error in both frequency and phase offset prediction. Furthermore, additional frequency and phase offsets were applied to the in vivo dataset, and DeepSPEC demonstrated better performance for FPC when compared to the MLP-based approach.
